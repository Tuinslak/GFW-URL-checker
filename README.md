# List of URLs blocked by the Great Firewall of China (Golden Shield Project)

â€¦ or at least, an attempt to create a list.

Checks once a day if the hosts (URLs) in the hosts directory are accessible and commits the output in two files (testResults/).

	results_ok.csv => list of hosts accessible (header 200 OK reply)
	results_nok.csv => list of hosts unaccessible (no reply)

Mind that it only check HTTP header responses, and doesn't actually check the content of the returned page (e.g. altered page content)	

Submit URLs, IPs or domains to <gfw@tuinslak.be>
